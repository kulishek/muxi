# muxi
MATLAB's user experience investigation project

**Muxi** project in its actual state is an endeavor to prototype API for the open-source full-featured 2D electron beam optics CAD/CAE system. 
Next step is a modern high-performance Poisson differential equation solver development, which needs to be implemented in parallel FORTRAN code.
